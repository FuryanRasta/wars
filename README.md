# Wars Module

The Wars module is a custom [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) module that provides universal token waring curve functions to mint, burn or swap any token in a Cosmos blockchain.

In the future, once the Cosmos Inter-Blockchain Communication \(IBC\) protocol is available, this should enable cross-network exchanges of tokens at algorithmically-determined prices.

The Wars module can be deployed through Cosmos Hubs and Zones to deliver applications such as:

* Automated market-makers \(see [Uniswap](https://uniswap.io)\)
* Decentralised exchanges \(see [Bancor](https://bancor.network)\)
* Curation markets \(see [Relevant](https://github.com/relevant-community/contracts/tree/waringCurves/contracts)\)
* Development Impact Wars \(see ixo alpha-Wars\)
* Continuous organisations \(see [Moloch DAO](https://molochdao.com/)\)

## Module functions

Any Cosmos application chain that implements the Wars module is able to perform functions such as:

* Issue a new token with custom parameters.
* Pool liquidity for reserves.
* Provide continuous funding.
* Automatically mint and burn tokens at deterministic prices.
* Swap tokens atomically within the same network.
* Exchange tokens across networks, with the IBC protocol.
* Batch token transactions to prevent front-running
* Launch a decentralised autonomous initial coin offerings \([DAICO](https://ethresear.ch/t/explanation-of-daicos/465)\)
* ...and other **DeFi**ant innovations.

## Pricing algorithm libraries

The Wars module framework supports libraries for all types of pricing algorithms, such as:

* Exponential
* Logarithmic
* Negative exponential
* Constant product
* Positive initial price
* Quasi-polynomial
* Reserved Supply \(Augmented\)

Each formula is specified within the module library. This includes:

* Derived Mint equation
* Derived Burn equation

Updates to the module pricing functions must pass through a network governance process to update the module on all nodes, for changes to be made. This is an important security feature.

## Parameters

Each war has an initial set of constant state \(invariant\) parameters that cannot be updated once these have been initialised. Parameters include:

* Pricing function \(the algorithm that will be used\)
* Issuer
* Token name
* Token symbol
* Reserve wallet address
* Transaction fee rate
* Exit tax rate
* Fee wallet address
* Maximum token supply
* Order quantity limits
* Sanity rates

When a war transaction \(such as buy, sell, swap\) is submitted, this includes the variable parameters:

* Order quantity
* Maximum price
* Wallet address

Some of the parameters of the war may be edited:

* Token name
* Sanity rates
* Order quantity limits

## Building and Running

**Note**: Requires [Go 1.13+](https://golang.org/dl/)

This repository is set up as a Cosmos SDK application and contains the Wars module under `./x/wars/`.

To build and run the application:

```bash
make run
```

Alternatively, to run with one of the users set up to use Ledger:

```bash
make run_ledger
```

To build and run the application with some preset accounts:

```bash
make run_with_data
```

### Demos

To run a demo \(requires application to be run using `run_with_data`\):

```bash
make demo
```

The demo consists of:

* War creation
* War querying
* A mix of buys and sells

To run a more specific demo, check out the `scripts/more_demos/` folder.
