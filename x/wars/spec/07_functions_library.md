# Functions Library
The Wars Module is deployed with a built-in set of libraries for commonly-used algorithmic pricing and reserve functions. It also includes algorithmic application logic and features, such as *Augmented Waring*. Additional functions can be added to the Library through SDK updates. This requires a formal process of governance to approve updates, to assure the integrity of these functions.

## Function Types
The following function types will be included in the standard Wars SDK Module:
* Power (exponential)
* Logistic (sigmoidal)
* Constant Product (swapper)
Algorithmic Applications include:
* Alpha Wars (Risk-adjusted waring)
* Innovation Wars (offers war shareholders contingent rights to future IP rights and/or revenues)
* Impact Wars (offers war shareholders contingent rights to success-based outcomes payments and/or rewards)
